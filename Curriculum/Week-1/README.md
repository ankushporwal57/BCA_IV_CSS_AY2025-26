## 📚 Week Overview

Week 1 introduces students to the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript. You'll learn how JavaScript interprets different data types, how operators work, and how to write your first programs. By the end of this week, you'll be comfortable working with numbers, strings, booleans, and performing basic calculations.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Understand JavaScript's basic elements (values, data types, operators)
- Perform arithmetic and logical operations
- Use the console effectively for testing and output
- Understand type conversion and coercion
- Write simple programs that interact with users
- Apply two different solution approaches to the same problem

## 🎯 Key Concepts Summary

### Values & Types
```javascript
const num = 42;              // Number
const text = "Hello";        // String
const flag = true;           // Boolean
const empty = null;          // Null (intentional emptiness)
const unknown = undefined;   // Undefined (no value assigned)
```

### Operators
```javascript
// Arithmetic
const sum = 10 + 5;          // 15
const diff = 10 - 5;         // 5
const product = 10 * 5;      // 50

// Comparison
if (10 > 5) { }              // true
if (10 === "10") { }         // false (strict equality)

// Logical
if (x > 5 && y < 10) { }     // AND
if (x > 5 || y < 10) { }     // OR
if (!flag) { }               // NOT
```

### Type Conversion
```javascript
const str = "42";
const num = Number(str);      // Convert to number: 42
const bool = Boolean(0);      // Convert to boolean: false
const back = String(num);     // Convert to string: "42"
```

## 🎓 Next Steps

After completing Week 1:

✅ **Week 1 is complete!**  
👉 **Move to [Week 2: Program Structure & Control Flow](../Week-2/README.md)**

Week 2 will teach you how to control the flow of your programs using conditionals and loops, allowing you to make decisions and repeat actions.

## 💬 Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to memorize all the operators?**  
A: No! It's better to understand what they do. With practice, they become second nature.

**Q: Why is `===` important?**  
A: It prevents unexpected type conversions. Always use `===` for comparisons.

**Q: Where can I test my code?**  
A: Use browser DevTools (F12 in Chrome) or Node.js in terminal. Both work great!
